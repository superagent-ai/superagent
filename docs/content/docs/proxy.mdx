Get started with Superagent in just a few simple steps.

## Step 1: Sign up

Sign up at [https://app.superagent.sh](https://app.superagent.sh)

## Step 2: Get your proxy link

1. Navigate to `/proxy` in your dashboard
2. Copy the proxy link

## Step 3: Update your existing application

Replace your existing OpenAI base URL with the Superagent proxy link.

```python title="Python SDK"
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="YOUR_PROXY_LINK_HERE",  # Replace with your proxy link
    api_key="your-openai-api-key"
)

# Use the client as usual
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}]
)
```

```typescript title="TypeScript/JavaScript SDK"
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'YOUR_PROXY_LINK_HERE', // Replace with your proxy link
  apiKey: 'your-openai-api-key',
});

// Use the client as usual
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello, world!' }],
});
```

That's it! Your application will now route through Superagent while maintaining full compatibility with the OpenAI API.
