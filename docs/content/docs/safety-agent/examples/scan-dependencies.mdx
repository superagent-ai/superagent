# Dependency Auditing

Audit open source repositories for AI-targeted attacks before adding them to your project.

## Quick Scan

```bash
# Before: npm install some-ai-helper
# First: scan the source repo
superagent scan --repo https://github.com/unknown-author/some-ai-helper
```

## Why This Matters

AI coding assistants read your `node_modules`, `requirements.txt`, and other dependency files. Malicious packages can contain:

- Hidden instructions in comments
- Prompt injection in docstrings
- Poisoned training data in examples
- Exfiltration code triggered by AI analysis

## Batch Scanning

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scan-deps.sh - Scan multiple repos

REPOS=(
  "https://github.com/author1/lib1"
  "https://github.com/author2/lib2"
)

for repo in "${REPOS[@]}"; do
  echo "Scanning: $repo"
  superagent scan --repo "$repo"
  echo "---"
done
```

## Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { createClient } from "safety-agent";

const client = createClient();

async function auditBeforeInstall(npmPackage: string, repoUrl: string) {
  const { result } = await client.scan({ repo: repoUrl });
  console.log(`Audit for ${npmPackage}:`, result);
}
```
