Superagent provides flexible deployment options to suit different security, compliance, and infrastructure requirements. All deployment options provide the same Guard, Verify, and Redact capabilities with consistent APIs.

## Docker Deployment (Recommended)

The fastest way to get Superagent running is with Docker Compose:

```bash title="Docker Deployment"
git clone https://github.com/superagent-ai/superagent.git
cd superagent
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start Superagent with all necessary dependencies.

## Node.js Deployment

For JavaScript/TypeScript environments:

```bash title="Node.js Setup"
git clone https://github.com/superagent-ai/superagent.git
cd superagent/node
npm install
npm start
```

The Node.js version provides easy integration with existing Node.js applications.

## Rust Deployment (High Performance)

For maximum performance and minimal resource usage:

```bash title="Rust Setup"
git clone https://github.com/superagent-ai/superagent.git
cd superagent/rust
cargo build --release
./target/release/ai-firewall start
```

The Rust implementation offers sub-100ms inference time and lower memory footprint.

## Configuration

Superagent uses a `vibekit.yaml` configuration file to define AI model providers and API endpoints:

```yaml title="vibekit.yaml Example"
models:
  - name: "openai-gpt-4"
    provider: "openai"
    endpoint: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
  - name: "anthropic-claude"
    provider: "anthropic"
    endpoint: "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
```

### Custom Configuration Path

You can specify a custom configuration file location:

```bash title="Custom Config"
# Node.js
npm start -- --config /path/to/your/vibekit.yaml

# Rust  
./target/release/ai-firewall start --config /path/to/your/vibekit.yaml
```

## Security Features

Once deployed, Superagent automatically provides:

- **Prompt Injection Protection**: Blocks malicious prompts with `[INJECTION]` placeholders
- **Backdoor Attack Prevention**: Detects and neutralizes backdoor attempts with `[BACKDOOR]` markers
- **Sensitive Data Filtering**: Redacts sensitive information with `[REDACTED]` replacements
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-100ms inference time using fine-tuned Gemma 3 270M model
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted security event logs
- **Graceful Fallback**: Continues operation even if firewall components are temporarily unavailable

## Production Considerations

- **High Availability**: Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer
- **Monitoring**: Monitor the structured JSON logs for security events
- **Performance**: Rust deployment recommended for high-throughput environments
- **Scaling**: Docker deployment supports horizontal scaling with orchestration platforms

Your Superagent API URL will be available at the configured endpoint (typically `http://localhost:8080`) and can be used as the base URL in your AI client configurations.
