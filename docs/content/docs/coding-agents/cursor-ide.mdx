description: Configure Cursor IDE to use Superagent by overriding the OpenAI Base URL in settings
---

Superagent provides seamless integration with Cursor IDE. Configure your base URL override in Cursor's settings to add AI firewall protection to your existing Cursor IDE workflows.

## Configuration via Settings UI

To configure Cursor IDE to use Superagent, follow these steps:

1. **Open Cursor Settings**
   - Use `Ctrl/Cmd + ,` or go to `File > Preferences > Settings`

2. **Navigate to Models Section**
   - In the settings panel, find and click on "Models"

3. **Configure OpenAI API Settings**
   - Locate the "OpenAI API Keys" section
   - Enter your OpenAI API key if you haven't already
   - Toggle ON "Override OpenAI Base URL (when using key)"
   - Enter your Superagent proxy URL in the base URL field

```text title="Base URL Configuration"
Base URL: YOUR_SUPERAGENT_PROXY_URL
```

4. **Save Configuration**
   - Click "Save" to apply the settings
   - Restart Cursor IDE if prompted

## Important Configuration Notes

- **Full Protocol Required**: Ensure your base URL includes the full protocol (e.g., `https://`)
- **API Version Endpoint**: The URL should point to the correct API version endpoint (typically ending with `/v1`)
- **API Key Compatibility**: Your API key must have access permissions matching the custom endpoint

## Migration Notes

- **No Code Changes Required**: Your existing Cursor IDE workflows work unchanged
- **Same Interface**: All Cursor IDE functionality remains identical
- **Added Protection**: Requests are now protected by Superagent's AI firewall
- **Complete Compatibility**: Full compatibility with all Cursor IDE features and models
- **Chat Models Only**: Custom base URLs work with standard chat models (Tab completion continues using Cursor's built-in models)

Simply configure your base URL override to your Superagent proxy URL and restart Cursor IDE to enable protection!
