description: Configure Claude Code to use Superagent by setting ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL in settings.json
---

Superagent provides seamless integration with Claude Code. Simply configure your base URL in Claude Code's settings to add AI firewall protection to your existing Claude Code workflows.

## Configuration via settings.json

To configure Claude Code to use Superagent, you need to set the `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` in your Claude Code settings.json file:

```json title="settings.json Configuration"
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "YOUR_SUPERAGENT_PROXY_URL"
  }
}
```

## Locating settings.json

The settings.json file is typically located at:

- **macOS**: `~/.config/claude-code/settings.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/claude-code/settings.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\claude-code\settings.json`

If the file doesn't exist, create it with the configuration above.

## Migration Notes

- **No Code Changes Required**: Your existing Claude Code workflows work unchanged
- **Same API Surface**: All Claude Code functionality remains identical
- **Added Protection**: Requests are now protected by Superagent's AI firewall
- **Complete Compatibility**: Full compatibility with all Claude Code features and models

Simply update your `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to your Superagent proxy URL and restart Claude Code to enable protection!
