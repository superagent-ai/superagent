description: Configure Gemini CLI to use Superagent by setting GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL in settings.json or environment variables
---

Superagent provides seamless integration with Gemini CLI. Configure your base URL in Gemini CLI's settings to add AI firewall protection to your existing Gemini CLI workflows.

## Configuration via settings.json

To configure Gemini CLI to use Superagent, you can set the base URL in your Gemini CLI settings.json file:

```json title="settings.json Configuration"
{
  "env": {
    "GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL": "YOUR_SUPERAGENT_PROXY_URL"
  }
}
```

## Configuration via Environment Variable

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable directly:

```bash title="Environment Variable Setup"
export GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL="YOUR_SUPERAGENT_PROXY_URL"
```

## Locating settings.json

The settings.json file is typically located at:

- **User settings**: `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- **Project settings**: `.gemini/settings.json` (in your project directory)

If the file doesn't exist, create it with the configuration above.

## Configuration Priority

Gemini CLI follows this configuration precedence order:
1. Command-line arguments (highest priority)
2. Environment variables
3. Project settings file (`.gemini/settings.json`)
4. User settings file (`~/.gemini/settings.json`)
5. System defaults (lowest priority)

## Migration Notes

- **No Code Changes Required**: Your existing Gemini CLI workflows work unchanged
- **Same API Surface**: All Gemini CLI functionality remains identical
- **Added Protection**: Requests are now protected by Superagent's AI firewall
- **Complete Compatibility**: Full compatibility with all Gemini CLI features and models

Simply update your `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` to your Superagent proxy URL and restart Gemini CLI to enable protection!
