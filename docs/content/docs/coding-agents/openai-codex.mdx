description: Configure OpenAI Codex to use Superagent by setting OPENAI_BASE_URL in settings.json
---

Superagent provides seamless integration with OpenAI Codex. Simply configure your base URL in OpenAI Codex's settings to add AI firewall protection to your existing OpenAI Codex workflows.

## Configuration via settings.json

To configure OpenAI Codex to use Superagent, you need to set the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` in your OpenAI Codex settings.json file:

```json title="config.toml"
# Built-in OpenAI provider can be customized here.
# [model_providers.openai]
# name = "OpenAI"
base_url = "https://firewall.superagent.sh # Replace with your Superagent proxy
```

## Locating settings.json

The settings.json file is typically located at:

- **macOS**: `~/.config/openai-codex/settings.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/openai-codex/settings.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\openai-codex\settings.json`

If the file doesn't exist, create it with the configuration above.

Simply update your `OPENAI_BASE_URL` to your Superagent proxy URL and restart OpenAI Codex to enable protection!
