description: Integrate Superagent with Anthropic SDK by simply updating your base URL
---

Superagent provides seamless integration with the Anthropic SDK. Simply replace your base URL to add AI firewall protection to your existing Anthropic applications.

## Python SDK

```python title="Python SDK Setup"
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    base_url="YOUR_SUPERAGENT_PROXY_URL",  # Replace with your Superagent proxy
    api_key="your-anthropic-api-key"
)

# Use the client as usual - no other changes needed
```

## TypeScript/JavaScript SDK

```typescript title="TypeScript/JavaScript SDK Setup"
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const anthropic = new Anthropic({
  baseURL: 'YOUR_SUPERAGENT_PROXY_URL', // Replace with your Superagent proxy
  apiKey: 'your-anthropic-api-key',
});

// Use the client as usual - no other changes needed
```

## Migration Notes

- **No Code Changes Required**: Your existing Anthropic SDK code works unchanged
- **Same API Surface**: All Anthropic SDK methods and parameters remain identical
- **Added Protection**: Requests are now protected by Superagent's AI firewall
- **Complete Compatibility**: Full compatibility with all Claude models and features

Simply update your `base_url` (Python) or `baseURL` (TypeScript) to your Superagent proxy URL and you're protected!
