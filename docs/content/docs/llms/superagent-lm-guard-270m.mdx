## Overview

SuperagentLM Guard 270M is a lightweight 270 million parameter edge variant optimized for lighter inference while maintaining strong safety detection capabilities.

## Threat Coverage

- Attempts that override system policies.
- Payloads such as reverse shells, ransomware droppers, or privilege escalation scripts.
- Requests focused on secrets, credentials, or regulated PII.
- Chains that try to coerce downstream models into unsafe behavior.

## Model Details

- **Architecture**: GPT-OSS-based architecture optimized for edge deployment.
- **Finetuning**: Instruction-tuned by Superagent for efficient edge inference.
- **Parameters**: 270M, optimized for CPU and edge GPU deployments.
- **Use case**: Ideal for edge deployments, mobile applications, or resource-constrained environments where latency and resource usage are critical.

## Download

Optimized for lighter inference: the Q8_0 GGUF package is ~1.7 GiB and the 16-bit checkpoint is ~1.5 GiB for users re-quantizing their own build.
