---

## Overview

SuperagentLM Redact 270M is a lightweight 270 million parameter model designed to detect and redact personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive data from text inputs, optimized for edge deployment and resource-constrained environments.

## Use Cases

- Automated PII detection and redaction in user inputs
- Compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA)
- Protecting sensitive information in logs and analytics
- Edge deployment scenarios with limited computational resources
- Mobile and IoT applications requiring on-device PII detection

## Model Details

- **Architecture**: Lightweight transformer model optimized for entity recognition and classification
- **Parameters**: 270M
- **Use case**: Edge deployments, mobile applications, or resource-constrained environments where latency and resource usage are critical

## Availability

This model is currently in development. Documentation for download links and evaluation benchmarks will be published upon release.
