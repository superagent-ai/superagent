title: SuperagentLM Guard 20B
description: 20B parameter guard model for real-time safety checks.
---

## Overview

SuperagentLM Guard 20B is a 20.9 billion parameter SLM (Small Language Model) that powers Superagent's reasoning-driven detection of prompt injections, backdoors, and data leaks.

## Threat Coverage

- Attempts that override system policies.
- Payloads such as reverse shells, ransomware droppers, or privilege escalation scripts.
- Requests focused on secrets, credentials, or regulated PII.
- Chains that try to coerce downstream models into unsafe behavior.

## Evaluation Benchmarks

| Model | Detection accuracy |
| --- | --- |
| Superagent-LM | 98% |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | 97% |
| GPT-5 | 94.5% |
| Sonnet-4 | 37% |
| Opus 4.1 | 24.5% |

These accuracy numbers come from Superagent's internal detection eval suite; higher values mean fewer missed exploits during guard checks.

## Model Details

- **Architecture**: GPT-OSS mixture-of-experts design with a 131k-token sliding attention context window, originally released as GPT-OSS 20B.
- **Finetuning**: Instruction-tuned by Superagent on top of `unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-unsloth-bnb-4bit` via Unsloth's accelerated pipeline.
- **Parameters**: 20.9B, exported as an 8-bit `superagent_lm_finetue.Q8_0.gguf` checkpoint for llama.cpp and compatible runtimes.
- **Package contents**: Includes the Transformer `config.json`, chat template, recommended generation params, and the Q8_0 GGUF weights (~22.3 GB) for easy deployment across CPU/GPU setups.

## Download

Expect large downloads: the quantized GGUF export is ~19.5 GiB, while the full-precision shards weigh in at roughly 40 GiB for BF16 workflows.

## Dataset

Superagent publishes the dataset behind its guard suite as a JSONL dataset (~39 MiB) so teams can reproduce benchmark checks locally.
