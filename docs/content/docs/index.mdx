title: What is Superagent?
description: Runtime protection for agents, copilots, and AI applications
---

Superagent provides runtime protection for production agents and copilots. It runs as a secure proxy between your apps, models, and tools — inspecting every prompt, response, file, and tool call before they reach downstream systems.

Point your OpenAI, Anthropic, or OSS model clients at the Superagent proxy and get real-time safeguards instantly. SuperagentLM, our reasoning-driven safety model, analyzes traffic with sub-50 ms latency so unsafe activity is blocked while valid workflows flow without friction.

## Why Superagent

- **Drop-in setup**: Swap your API base URL for the Superagent proxy — no refactor required  
- **Agent-native**: Purpose-built to cover prompts, tool calls, function invocations, and file attachments  
- **Stops real threats**: Detects and blocks prompt injections, malicious calls, data exfiltration, and backdoors  
- **Complete visibility**: Stream structured logs, audits, and decisions into your existing security stack

## How Superagent Protects

1. **Intercept**: Superagent sits as a secure proxy between your app, models, and tools  
2. **Analyze**: SuperagentLM reasons over prompts, responses, and payloads to detect injections, leaks, and misuse  
3. **Protect**: Runtime policies block, redact, or quarantine threats while safe calls pass through untouched  
4. **Monitor**: Stream logs, metrics, and alerts for full transparency and auditability  

## Deployment Options

- **Hosted**: Managed solution that launches in seconds, scales automatically, and requires no infrastructure  
- **Self-hosted**: Deploy inside your VPC for full data ownership and enterprise-grade controls
