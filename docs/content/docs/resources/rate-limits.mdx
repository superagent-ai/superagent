description: API rate limits and usage quotas for Superagent
---

Superagent enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and maintain service quality across all users. Our rate limiting follows the same structure as Fireworks AI.

## Fixed Rate Limits

The platform enforces the following maximum usage caps:

- **Requests**: 6,000 requests per minute


## Rate Limit Response Headers

API responses include headers to help you track your current usage:

- `x-ratelimit-remaining-requests`: Number of remaining requests or tokens available
- `x-ratelimit-over-limit`: Indicates whether your requests are being deprioritized (value: `yes` or `no`)

## Higher Rate Limits

If you need higher rate limits for your use case, please contact our support team to discuss custom rate limits and GPU capacity options.
