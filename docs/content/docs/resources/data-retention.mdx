description: Data retention and privacy policies for Superagent
---

Superagent is committed to protecting your data privacy and security. We implement a zero-retention policy to ensure your sensitive information remains confidential.

## Zero Data Retention

**Superagent enforces zero retention on all data** processed through our APIs. This means:

- **No prompt storage**: Your input prompts are not stored or logged
- **No response storage**: Model outputs and responses are not retained
- **No file storage**: Uploaded files (for Guard, Verify, or Redact) are immediately discarded after processing
- **No conversation history**: We do not maintain conversation logs or chat histories

Your data is processed in real-time and discarded immediately after the API response is delivered.

## What We Do Store

The **only data** we retain is:

- **Token usage metrics**: The number of tokens used per request for billing and usage tracking purposes

These metrics contain no content from your requests or responsesâ€”only numerical counts for billing transparency.

## Training on Your Data

**Superagent does not train models on your data** unless you explicitly request it. Our purpose-trained models (Guard, Verify, and Redact) are pre-trained and deployed for production use.

If you're interested in custom model training or fine-tuning for your specific use case, please contact our team to discuss options and explicit data sharing agreements.

## Compliance and Security

Our zero-retention policy helps you maintain compliance with:

- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **SOC 2** compliance standards
- **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act)

Since we don't retain your data, there's no risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, or compliance violations related to stored customer data.
