# 🥷 Superagent

**Guard. Verify. Redact.**

Purpose-trained models that secure your applications and keep them compliant — with low-latency, production-ready performance.

## What is Superagent?

Superagent provides the security and compliance capabilities you need to ship with confidence. We've built three purpose-trained models — Guard, Verify, and Redact — that work as standalone APIs to protect your applications in real time, without slowing you down.

Whether you're building agents, chatbots, or workflows, Superagent gives you the tools to detect threats, validate outputs, and protect sensitive data before they become problems.

## Capabilities

### Guard
Detects and blocks unsafe inputs, prompt injections, malicious tool calls, and backdoors before they reach your models or systems. With **98% threat detection accuracy**, Guard outperforms GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and other frontier models — without the latency penalty.

### Verify
Grounds and validates model outputs against your enterprise sources, documents, or APIs. Every generation is factual, consistent, and policy-aligned. Stop hallucinations from reaching production.

### Redact
Removes sensitive data (PII, PHI, secrets) from text, logs, or documents in real time. Enable privacy and compliance across AI inputs and outputs without manual review.

## How to use it?

Superagent fits into your workflow, no matter how you build:

- **API**: [Documentation](https://docs.superagent.sh/rest-api/guard) — Send any payload and receive a guarded, verified, or redacted result. Supports JSON, text, or document inputs.
- **SDKs**: [Python](https://docs.superagent.sh/sdks/python-sdk), [TypeScript](https://docs.superagent.sh/sdks/typescript-sdk) — Lightweight client libraries for embedding Guard, Verify, or Redact directly into your workflows and orchestration layers.
- **CLI**: [Documentation](https://docs.superagent.sh/cli) — Command-line tool for developers and ops teams to test, audit, or batch-process data locally.

All access methods share the same core engine and authentication model — simple to integrate, fast to deploy, and ready for production from day one.

### Get Started

To use the API, sign up on [Superagent](https://app.superagent.sh) and get your API key. You'll be up and running in minutes.

## Why Superagent?

- **Low-latency protection** — Optimized for runtime use without compromising security or performance
- **Open source (MIT)** — Full transparency with 10K+ GitHub stars and community trust
- **Framework-agnostic** — Works seamlessly with any LLM provider, agent framework, or orchestration layer
- **Compliance-ready** — Maps to EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF, GDPR, SOC 2, and HIPAA requirements
- **Flexible deployment** — Choose hosted cloud or self-hosted infrastructure based on your needs
- **Production-proven** — Battle-tested by Y Combinator companies and enterprises shipping AI at scale

## Use Cases

- **Customer-facing applications**: Protect chatbots and assistants from prompt injection and malicious inputs
- **Enterprise workflows**: Validate outputs against internal knowledge bases and policy documents
- **Data pipeline security**: Automatically redact PII/PHI from logs, documents, and datasets
- **Agent safety**: Monitor and control autonomous agent actions before execution
- **Compliance automation**: Build audit trails and ensure regulatory alignment across all models
